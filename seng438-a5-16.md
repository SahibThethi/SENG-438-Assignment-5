# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
We followed a similar division of work as in our previous assignments, with Rohan and Wade focusing on the Reliability Demonstration Chart section, while Sukriti and Sahib worked on the Reliability Growth Testing. All team members actively contributed by assisting each other with roadblocks and providing support whenever needed. Overall, we believe the workload was shared fairly evenly among the four of us, and everything was completed on time without the need for additional reminders or assistance from outside the group.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Both teams encountered significant difficulties while working on their respective sections of the lab. For the team working on the Reliability Growth Testing, the primary challenge was running the C-SFRAT software tool. The program frequently crashed whenever any parameters such as intervals or the failure intensity target was modified. This led to considerable frustration and time loss, as we often had to restart the program and re-import the data from scratch. Additionally, there was a noticeable lack of guidance or resources on how to generate the required plots, which forced us to rely on trial and error and our own judgment to complete this part of the assignment.

The team working on the Reliability Demonstration Chart section also faced obstacles. Certain spreadsheet cells that were supposed to be editable were locked and marked as unchangeable, which caused confusion during data input. Furthermore, there was uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the generated plots, and even the TAs were unsure about some aspects, leading to uncertainity when submitting the assignment. Despite these setbacks, teamwork played a key role in helping us navigate through most of the difficulties. This collaborative effort enabled us to complete the assignment to the best of our abilities.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Compared to the previous labs, this assignment lacked clear and detailed instructions. The guidance on how to use the C-SFRAT software and how to properly generate the required plots was particularly unclear. Additionally, there were numerous failure datasets provided, and selecting the most appropriate one for producing meaningful graphs proved to be a challenge. More structured instructions and clarity around these aspects would have made the assignment smoother and less time-consuming.
